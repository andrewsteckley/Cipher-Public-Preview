# Cipher-Public-Preview

This is a public preview of my Cipher project for solving the infamous Zodiac Killer cipher.

I started this project one evening a couple of years ago, casually looking at the unsolved Z340 cipher that the Zodiac Killer sent to authorities back in 1969. Since then, I have devoted well over 1000 hours, breaking down and solving the problem, and I've made distinct, demonstable progress. 

The project includes a multi-level system of models and tools for systematically attacking and breaking homophonic substitution ciphers. There are a few dozen notebooks, about 10,000 lines of python code, almost a TB of generated training data, and several machine learning and predictive models that compreise deep neural networks (convolutional and recursive), and genetic algorithms. 

Given my progress and the desire to compile the entire effort into a publication, I am not ready to make the project public.
